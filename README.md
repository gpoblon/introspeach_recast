# introspeach_recast

This repo contains my first chatbot powered by recast.ai.

It is supposed to introduce another chatbot (Speach) which will be the main projet.

Speach is a teenagers sexual conversational assistant. It allows boys and girls from 13 to 18 to healthily discover and manage their firsts steps into sexuality, IE risks prevention, pleasure, first time, dealing with attraction and love and sex, harassment, and so on.

Anyway IntroSpeach has a main mission : introduce Speach and what it does to people. I might later split conversational features depending on whether it is talking with a kid or his parents.
The secondary mission of this bot is a market reseach to ensure we're dealing with this society issue the right way.

I'm using recast mainly as a NLP service but I will use its bot builder to have a better understanding of the way it handles things.

Why using only NLP features ?
Most bots are used as customers service : reserving a flight, a restaurant table, a train for example. Some have a more complex or specific usage : companies intern bots, cultural or fasion ones.
But only a few bots are developped for conversational usage and I don't even know any bot that can properly hold a conversation about as much topics we want to cover.
For that, we'll need an homemade builder. We'll develop our own interface which will be used by psychologists, sexologists for exemple to fulfill our gigantic tree of topics.
